1. Write	Rectangle	class to	represent	a	rectangle.	The	class	contains:
• Two	double	data	fields	named	width	and	height	that	specify	the	width	and	height	of	the
rectangle.	The	default	values	are	1	for	both	width	and	height.
• A	no-arg	constructor	that	creates	a	default	rectangle.
• A	constructor	that	creates	a	rectangle	with	the specified	width	and	height.
• A	method	named	getArea()	that	returns	the	area	of	this	rectangle.
• A	method	named	getPerimeter()	that	returns	the	perimeter.
2. Write	a	program	that	creates	a	Date	object,	sets	its	elapsed	time	to	10000,	100000,	1000000,
10000000,	100000000,	1000000000,	10000000000,	and	100000000000,	and	displays	the	date
and	time	using	the	toString()	method,	respectively.
Exercises
3. Design	a	class	named	Account	that	contains:
• A	private	int	data	field	named	id	for	the	account	(default	0).
• A	private	double	data	field	named	balance	for	the	account	(default	0).
• A	private	double	data	field	named	annualInterestRate	that	stores	the	current	interest
rate	(default	0).	Assume	all	accounts	have	the	same	interest	rate.
• A	private	Date	data	field	named	dateCreated	that	stores	the	date	when	the	account
was	created.
• A	no-arg	constructor	that	creates	a	default	account.
• A	constructor	that	creates	an	account	with	the	specified	id	and	initial	balance.
• The	accessor	and	mutator	methods	for	id,balance,	and	annualInterestRate.
• The	accessor	method	for	dateCreated.
• A	method	named	getMonthlyInterestRate()	that	returns	the	monthly	interest	rate.
• A	method	named	getMonthlyInterest()	that	returns	the	monthly	interest.
• A	method	named	withdraw	that	withdraws	a	specified	amount	from	the	account.
• A	method	named	deposit	that	deposits	a	specified	amount	to	the	account.
Implement	the	class.	(Hint:	The	method	getMonthlyInterest()	is	to	return	monthly
interest,	not	the	interest	rate.	Monthly	interest	is
balance*monthlyInterestRate.monthlyInterestRate	is	annualInterestRate	/	12.	Note
that	annualInterestRate	is	a	percentage,	e.g.,	like	4.5%.	You	need	to	divide	it	by	100.)
Write	a	test	program	that	creates	an	Account object	with	an	account	ID	of	1122,	a
balance	of	$20,000,	and	an	annual	interest	rate	of	4.5%.	Use	the	withdraw	method	to
withdraw	$2,500,	use	the	deposit	method	to	deposit	$3,000,	and	print	the	balance,	the
monthly	interest,	and	the	date	when	this	account was	created.
