Tutorials
1. Write	a	program	that	reads	in	the	radius	and	length	of	a	cylinder	and	computes	the	area	and
volume	using	the	following	formulas.
area	=	radius	*	radius	*	π
volume	=	area	*	length
2. A	year	is	a	leap	year,	if	it	is	divisible	by	4.		When	user	keys	in	a	year,	write	a	program	to
determine	if	the	year	is	a	leap	year	or	not.
3. Body	Mass	Index	(BMI)	is	a	measure	of	health	on	weight.	It	can	be	calculated	by	taking	your
weight	in	kilograms	and	dividing	by	the	square	of	your	height	in	meters.	Write	a	program	that
prompts	the	user	to	enter	a	weight	in	pounds	and	height	in	inches	and	displays	the	BMI.	Note
that	one	pound	is	0.45359237	kilograms	and	one	inch	is	0.0254	meters.
Exercises
4. Write	a	program	that	calculates	the	energy	needed	to	heat	water	from	an	initial	temperature	to
a	final	temperature.	Your	program	should	prompt	the	user to	enter	the	amount	of	water	in
kilograms	and	the	initial	and	final	temperatures	of	the	water.	The	formula	to	compute	the
energy	is
Q	=	M	*	(finalTemperature	– initialTemperature)	*	4184
where	M	is	the	weight	of	water	in	kilograms,	temperatures	are	in	degrees	Celsius,	and	energy	Q
is	measured	in	joules.

5. Write	a	program	that	reads	in	investment	amount,	annual	interest	rate,	and	number	of	years,
and	displays	the	future	investment	value	using	the	following	formula:
futureInvestmentValue	=	investmentAmount	*	(1	+	monthlyInterestRate) numberOfYears*12
For	example,	if	you	enter	amount	1000,	annual	interest	rate	3.25%,	and	number	of	years	1,	the
future	investment	value	is	1032.98.
